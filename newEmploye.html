        <p>My Shadow</p>
            <p> by Robert Louis Stevenson</p>
            
           <p> I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,
            And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.
            He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;
            And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.
            </p>
            <p>
            The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow—
            Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;
            For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,
            And he sometimes gets so little that there’s none of him at all.
